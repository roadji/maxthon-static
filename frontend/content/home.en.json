    "mission": {"title": "Our Mission", "content": "For many years, Maxthon Universal Exchange Centre has delivered high‑quality study tours for universities, secondary and primary schools, and social service organisations in Hong Kong. Through travel, participants experience, feel, learn, share and internalise diverse learning elements. We are committed to providing a rich and varied learning process so that students can explore local customs and cultural characteristics across regions, integrating the idea of ‘learning through play and travelling through learning’ into every journey. This enriches knowledge, broadens horizons and helps students set their sights on the global stage.\n\nWe have extensive experience organising themed study tours and have long been highly regarded by the education sector. Schools can define clear study tour goals and plans with us according to their needs and themes. Our professional team will make meticulous arrangements and help you coordinate the entire journey. Understanding the workload and needs of educators, we provide reliable, worry‑free arrangements to help you plan an efficient and truly well‑rounded trip."}
